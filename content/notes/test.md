# Every web browser absolutely sucks.
The title explains it all, you don't even have to read.

There are no good, even passable web browser. None. Not a single one even comes close.

The wired thing is this: making good browser should be easy!

Again, no browser out there has all the traits of even a passable browser, but we might as well list them all here for the record.

No reason to expain this. Absolutely insane to use a program to browse the internet whose source code isn't publicly auditable.
